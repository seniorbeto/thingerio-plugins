# Documentation


Thinger.io's technical documentation is available at [docs.thinger.io](https://docs.thinger.io), with a dedicated plugins marketplace portal at this URL ([marketplace.thinger.io](https://marketplace.thinger.io)).

To make it easier for the users to evaluate the plugins available and to help them configure it, every new plugin should include a dedicated page, with a description.

Documentation source is handled through the same repository as the source files of the plugin and in the same subfolder, written in Markdown.
