Thinger.io plugins are extensions that allow complementing Thinger.io Platform with additional features or creating integrations with third-party services, data analytics algorithms or custom software.

Before developing a plugin, it may be useful to familiarize with the infrastructure built by Thinger.io to work with additional services under the [Plugins System Infrastructure](/plugins-system-infrastructure) section.

## Repository content

This repository contains all available integrations for Thinger.io Marketplace.

The wiki documents the file structure of the plugins as well as how to development and how to contribute to this repo so all the community can benefit from everyone's participation.
