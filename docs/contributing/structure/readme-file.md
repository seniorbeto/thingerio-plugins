# Readme

The `README.md` file servers three purposes:

- See the description while navigating GitHub plugins
- See the description inside the Thinger.io Marketplace
- See the description in the official [Thinger.io Docs](https://docs.thinger.io/plugins)

Therefore, and to enrich these locations, the file must be present and be as verbose as possible, including images and any necessary resource.
