# SFTPGo Plugin Version 2.5.4-1

Alongside with the support of one of our customers  we've integrated [SFTPGo](https://sftpgo.com/), a new Plugin to add capabilities to File Storages, adding support for SFTP, FTP and FTPS with individual user management. With this plugin you can leverage Thinger.io file storage backends for exchanging and storing files on the platform.

The support for this plugin in Thinger.io starts from the server version 5.3.6.
