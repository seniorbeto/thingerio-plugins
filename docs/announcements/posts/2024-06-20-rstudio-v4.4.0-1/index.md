In an effort to provide different development environments within Thinger.io for Time Series Data Analysis, we are pleased to announce the release of the [RStudio Plugin](https://marketplace.thinger.io/plugins/rstudio/) for Thinger.io.

This new plugin provides a web-based RStudio Server instance that can be accessed from the Thinger.io console. RStudioÂ® is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, a programming language for statistical computing and graphics. The RStudio Web IDE plugin can greatly benefit data scientists, IoT developers, and researchers who need to analyze and visualize IoT data effectively.

From Thinger.io we hope that this integration is found useful by professionals across various domains to make data-driven decisions and optimize their IoT solutions.

Check the [documentation for the plugin](/plugins/rstudio/), which contains a plugin overview, integration details, and a guide to get started with RStudio in Thinger.io.
