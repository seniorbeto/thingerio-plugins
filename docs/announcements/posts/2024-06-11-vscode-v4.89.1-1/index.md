# VS Code Plugin Version 4.89.1-1

Last week we released a new version of the [Thinger.io VS Code Extension](https://community.thinger.io/t/vscode-extension-and-arduino-library-for-thinger-io/5148) with some improvements in the Remote OTA Programming feature.

With this new version of the VS Code Plugin for Thinger.io, you will be able benefit from this updates directly from the Cloud, and have a fully integrated development environment for your IoT projects.

We encourage you to check the [documentation for the plugin](/plugins/vscode/) as well as for the [OTA programming](https://docs.thinger.io/ota).
