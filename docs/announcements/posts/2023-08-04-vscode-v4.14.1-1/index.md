</p>

As part of this version both PlatformioIO and Thinger.io Visual Studio Code extensions are installed on first boot, and the necessary credentials are configured automatically, so no other configuration from the users are needed.

Checkout the [documentation for the plugin](/plugins/vscode/) as well as for the [OTA programming](https://docs.thinger.io/extended-features/ota#firmware-upload-via-ota).

## Highlights

- Preinstallation of platformio-ide and thinger-io extension
- Default settings for Thinger.io extension configuration
