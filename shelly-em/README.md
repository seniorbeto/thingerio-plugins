# Shelly EM

Shelly EM is a Wi-Fi-operated energy meter with contactor control. It allows you to simultaneously monitor the consumption of any home appliances, electric circuits, and office equipment (lights, power lines, security systems, heating, cooling, etc.) in 2 circuits on the same phase or individually. Shelly EM is perfect for measuring solar energy production, monitoring household consumption, and controlling heavier-load appliances.
