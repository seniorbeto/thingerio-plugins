# Prometheus Exporter Plugin

<!-- TODO: Prometheus and Thinger logo -->

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thinger-io/Node-RED/master/images/screely.png" width="1024px">

An exporter for exposing metrics of Thinger.io server resources in Prometheus and OpenMetrics format from an endpoint.

The plugins allows the definition of the desired metrics by programatically configuring extraction of the values against one of three backends:
- Thinger.io Database
- (TODO) Data Buckets
- (TODO) Thinger.io API

## Getting Started

Documentation of the plugin and how to use it can be found at Thinger.io docs. <!-- TODO -->

Metrics are configured using the unofficial Prometheus client for Node.js, coded through the gui of the plugin.
